/**
 * Instructions:
 *
 * Getting Started
 * ==========================
 *
 * This is the entry point for your route handler. The function exported from this file will be
 * run when your specified API route is called. Polymerase will normalize the request and
 * populate the request object to be very similar in structure to an Express request handler.
 * For more information on the properties and methods available in the request and response objects,
 * you may visit the document site: https://polymerase.readme.io/v1.0.0/docs/route-handler-reference
 *
 * Common libraries
 * ==========================
 *
 * You may access any of the common libraries in the "src/lib" folder using a simple require
 * statement. For example, if you wanted to use a module you wrote located at
 * "src/lib/config.js", you could access it with require("lib/config").
 *
 * NPM Modules
 * ==========================
 *
 * NPM modules should be installed using the package.json file located in the root folder of
 * this service.
